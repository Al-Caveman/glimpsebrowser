**Note:** this is a fork with Q*browser, except without the bad Q-word, so that
it becomes safe for use at work and school.

* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3.5 or newer (3.6 recommended)
* https://www.qt.io/[Qt] 5.7.1 or newer (5.12 recommended due to https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-76913[segfaults on media pages with Qt 5.13]); support for < 5.9

* http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] to generate the documentation for the `:help`
  command, when using the git repository (rather than a release).

See link:doc/install.asciidoc[the documentation] for directions on how to
install glimpsebrowser and its dependencies.

Donating
--------

Working on glimpsebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money (as an example, I have to pay for the server and
domain).

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!

Sponsors
--------

Thanks a lot to https://www.macstadium.com/[MacStadium] for supporting
glimpsebrowser with a free hosted Mac Mini via their
https://www.macstadium.com/opensource[Open Source Project].

(They don't require including this here - I've just been very happy with their
offer, and without them, no macOS releases or tests would exist)

Thanks to the https://www.hsr.ch/[HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil], which
made it possible to work on glimpsebrowser extensions as a student research project.
